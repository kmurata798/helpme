# HelpMe (Internet Forum)
# Description
HelpMe is a website that allows users to post public questions and useful information relating to school topics.
Users have the ability to view all the posts that they have created, as well as go back and edit the details.
As the website beomes improved, there will be an option for other users to post within a primary post, giving feedback to the primary post.

# Motivation
Throughout the years I have been attending school, I have been in a number of classes in which I would struggle to keep up with certain lessons/skills being taught. I would communicate with classmates and teachers to get any questions I can get answered. But there are many occasions where I can't get my questions answered through my usual resources.

HelpME would provide students with another 'go-to' ONLINE resource where they can rely on receiving help for school purposes(ex. Homework, studying tips, etc...)

HelpMe would also benefit those who have finished schools and are looking for information relating to education (ex. Computer Science, English, Math, etc...)

# Code Structure

Used Jinja templates to link the HTML templates to Python app.py
